~ Kariin Project ~

The Kariin Project was created to serve as a backup for the Azurarea Project. As a fellow manga reader, I created the Kariin Project to make it easily accessible to users. Since the Kariin Project is still in beta testing, it will likely take about a month to complete, as I need to integrate the API and other necessary things.

âœ¨Thank you for your attention. I apologize for not being able to release the alpha version sooner. ðŸ™Œ
